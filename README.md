How to use this
• Insert your master data in the Master Data table.
• In the Drop-Downs tab, enter your values by selecting from dropdowns
• Rename the columns as needed in Drop-Downs and Master Data. You may delete and add columns to accomodate your required number of levels.
• If you need to add a column, simply copy the rightmost one

How this works
• A dynamic array formula builds a table with the list contents for each possible selection combinations in the Work tab. 
• A single named range is used to populate the list at each level
