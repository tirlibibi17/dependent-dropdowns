#How to use this

• Insert your master data in the Master Data table.

• In the Drop-Downs tab, enter your values by selecting from dropdowns

• Rename the columns as needed in Drop-Downs and Master Data. You may delete and add columns to accomodate your required number of levels.

• If you need to add a column, simply copy the rightmost one



#How this works

• A dynamic array formula builds a table with the list contents for each possible selection combinations in the Work tab.

• A single named range is used to populate the list at each level
